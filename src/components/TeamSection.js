  const fullBio = `I organize my work around a fundamental belief: that equitable access to capital can transform underserved communities and address critical social determinants of health. Throughout my career spanning more than 14 years, I have consistently delivered results by leveraging my expertise in financial analysis, community development, and tax credit finance.

As the founder of Clarity Impact Finance, I partner with CDFIs and mission-driven lenders to optimize their operations, strengthen their impact measurement frameworks, and unlock new capital sources. My approach combines financial expertise with a commitment to improving housing, healthcare, education, and childcare access in low-income communities.

Prior to launching Clarity Impact Finance, I served as Vice President of National Community Facilities Lending & New Market Tax Credit at Low Income Investment Fund, where I led initiatives to expand community facilities in underserved areas.

My experience includes managing a portfolio of real estate private equity funds at Aviva Investors and supporting high-net-worth clients with wealth management services at Bank of New York Mellon. I also founded GroceryBox, an online grocery marketplace delivering essentials to seniors and people with disabilities.

I hold a B.Com in Finance and Accounting from McGill University and am a CFA Charterholder. I remain actively engaged in community service through volunteer work with the Mental Health Association of Rockland and previously with the Grameen Foundation's Bankers Without Borders program, and Yonkers YMCA.

What drives me most is witnessing the tangible differences that strategic capital deployment makes in people's livesâ€”whether through affordable housing developments, community health centers, quality educational facilities, or accessible childcare options.`;
